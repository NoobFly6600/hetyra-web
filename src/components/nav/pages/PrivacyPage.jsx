            Most browsers allow you to remove or disable cookies. To do this,
            follow the instructions in your browser's settings. Many browsers

            properly. For more information about cookies, including how to view,

            our site. You can learn more about Google Analytics cookies at

          <h3 className="h4 mb-3">Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network
            Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance
            (DAA). You can learn more about these companies' data collection
            practices and opt-out of interest-based advertising by visiting:

            <li className="mb-2">DAA Opt-Out</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-3">
            If you use a mobile device, you can install the AppChoices app to
            limit interest-based ads by participating DAA members, available at
            AppChoices. Additionally, you can block third-party cookies in your
            browser settings or use privacy plug-ins or ad-blocking software to
            limit the collection of data for interest-based advertising. Mobile
            devices may also offer settings to limit the use of advertising IDs
            for targeted ads.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Please note that even after opting out, you may still see ads, but
            they may be less relevant to you.
